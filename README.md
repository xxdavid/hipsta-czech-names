# Hipsta Czech names
Have you ever wanted to know the weirdest forenames in the Czech Republic. Now you can!

The names sorted by frequency are available as [text](names.txt) and [JSON](names.json).

You can generate the output files yourself by running `index.js`.

## Source
The `data.csv` file was downloaded from [Ministry of the interior of the Czech Republic](http://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/cetnost-jmen-a-prijmeni-722752.aspx). Then it was converted to .csv and UTF-8. No further changes were made.
